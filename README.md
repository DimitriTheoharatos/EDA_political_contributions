# Exploratory Data Analysis of AZ Political Contributions in the 2016 Presidential Election

This project investigates contributions made from Arizonans to the 2016 presidential contenders.  The exploration is implemented using R in an RStudio programming environment.  The R Markdown notebook contains all of the of the code used in the exploration and the AZ_political_contributions.html displays the generated report from knitting the notebook.  The dataset used for investigation is also uploaded. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* RStudio


### Executing the Project

In order to run the project yourself, you will need RStudio (any version should work).  The R Markdown file attached in the repo can then be used to investigate the code snippets that generate the plots.  Each snippet of the code could be run as well without the entire RStudio IDE installed, but will not be organized in the same manner.  All of the necessary packages to be installed are included within the R markdown file.
